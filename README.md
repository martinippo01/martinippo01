Hi! I'm Martin Ippolito, but people call me ippo.

I'm a a software engineer student at ITBA (Buenos Aires, ARG). 

During the past years I have worked in WÃºru, as a front-end developer, and did a couple of projects that you can find here. But in case you want to know more or if you want to see the project in action you can view them at [my website](https://ippo.com.ar/#projects)
