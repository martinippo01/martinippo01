Hi! I'm Martin Ippolito, but people call me ippo.

I'm a Software Engineer Intern at WÃºru and a software engineer student at ITBA (Buenos Aires, ARG). 

During the past years I have worked in a couple of projects that you can find here. But in case you want to know more or if you want to see the project in action you can view it at [my website](https://ippo.com.ar/#projects)
